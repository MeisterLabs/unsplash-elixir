# Unsplash [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/waynehoover/unsplash-elixir.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/waynehoover/unsplash-elixir) [![Hex pm](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/unsplash.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/unsplash)

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) API wrapper in Elixir.


## Exmaple Usage

* `Unsplash.Photos.search(query: "Austin", catgeroy: "2") |> Enum.take(1)`
* `Unsplash.Collections.all |> Enum.take(1)`
* All [API endpoints](https://unsplash.com/documentation) are supported. See the [documentation](http://hexdocs.pm/unsplash/Unsplash.html) for full list.

Each API call that is paginated returns a stream. You can resolve the stream by calling any Enum function, this way you don't have to think about pagination. For example to get one random photo: `Unsplash.Photos.random |> Enum.take(1)` or to get 100 random photos: `Unsplash.Photos.random |> Enum.take(100)`.


## Configuration

See the `secrets.exs` file on what configuration variables need to be configured.


## Authorization

Get an auth code by directing a user to the url generated by this command (replace the scope with what you would like):
`Unsplash.OAuth.authorize_url! scope: "public read_user write_user read_photos write_photos write_likes read_collections write_collections"`

After the user grants access, she will be redirected back to your redirect_uri whith a `code` query paramater, which you then set like this:
`Unsplash.OAuth.authorize!(code: auth_code_from_the_callback)`

Now every API call will use the access_code gerenated in the above step automatically.


## Installation

1. Add unsplash to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:unsplash, "~> 1.0.0"}]
    end
```

2. Ensure unsplash is started before your application:
```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:unsplash]]
    end
```
